First, go to SPP\app\src\main\java\com\example\spp\MainActivity.java 
to change:

private static String address

to whatever the MAC address of your own RFS Daughter Card's Bluetooth HC-05 module is. 

Use the "Bluetooth Pair" app from the Android play store to connect to the RFS when everything is connected and powered on. 
Bluetooth and Location services MUST be on. 

When everything is set up, running this app on your own Android phone will send the string "Hello, Jason the great!!!\n"
