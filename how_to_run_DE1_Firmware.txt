1. Open Quartus Project, use Programmer to load .sof onto DE1
2. Use OpenConnect to connect to UBC ECE license. 
3. Run "eclipse &" from EDS command shell as administrator.

4. Download preloader by running command below in SoC EDS 15.0 Command Shell:
C:/Altera/15.0/quartus/bin64/quartus_hps --cable="DE-SoC [USB-1]" -o GDBSERVER --gdbport0=3335 --preloader=C:/Altera/15.0/University_Program/Monitor_Program/arm_tools/u-boot-spl.srec --preloaderaddr=0xffff1398

5. When "Starting GDB Server." shows up, press Ctrl-C to let DS5 start GDB server by itself.

6. In order for Wi-fi to work (currently), before running the C code in DS5, use a jumper wire to touch the Wifi reset signal on the RFS to Ground. 
This means touching pin 2 to pin 12 which are the 1st and 6th metals pins from the top, when looking at the back of the RFS(with ribbon cable connector on right side).

7. The Scatter file may have to be reselected Project's Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Tool Settings -> Arm Linker 5 -> Image Layout. Choose scatter file here.

8. In DS5, Build Project, then do Debug As->Debug Configurations, select CPEN391_Config and press Debug.
9. Press "Run" (green arrow button).

notes: 
- above preloader command can be run before starting eclipse in instruction 3.
- wifi network and password needs to be set in WIFI_Init function in WIFI.c
- EDS = Altera Embedded Command Shell
