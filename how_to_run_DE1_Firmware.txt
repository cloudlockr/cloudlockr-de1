How to run DE1 firmware:

1. Open Quartus Project, use Programmer to load .sof onto DE1
2. Use OpenConnect to connect to UBC ECE license. 
3. Run "eclipse &" from EDS command shell as administrator.
4. Download preloader using command above (in EDS command shell). 
5. Press Ctrl + C to stop GDB server. 

6. In order for Wi-fi to work (currently), before running the C code in DS5, use a jumper wire to touch the Wifi reset signal on the RFS to Ground. 
This means touching pin 2 to pin 12 which are the 1st and 6th metals pins from the top, when looking at the back of the RFS.

7. In DS5, Build Project, then do Debug As->Debug Configurations, select CPEN391_Config and press Debug.
8. Press "Run" (green arrow button).
