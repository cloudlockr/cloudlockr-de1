First, go to SPP\app\src\main\java\com\example\spp\MainActivity.java 
to change:

private static String address

to whatever the MAC address of your own RFS Daughter Card's Bluetooth HC-05 module is. 

Use the "Bluetooth Pair" app from the Android play store to connect to the RFS when everything is connected and powered on. 
Bluetooth and Location services MUST be on. 
Press "Start Bluetooth Scan" to search nearby devices for HC-05 on the RFS, and the password to enter is "1234", which is the default for HC-05. 

When everything is set up, running this app on your own Android phone will send the string "Hello, Jason the great!!!\n"
